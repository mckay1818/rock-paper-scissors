# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This in-browser game of rock, paper, scissors was created as part of [The Odin Project's Foundations Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations). The project
was first written in a single HTML file for in-console play. The original code was later adapted and expanded to create a UI. 
While building this game, I gained experience implementing many front-end development skills, including:  
 - **Algorithmic Problem Solving:** Prior to writing code, created and refined a high-level algorithm to understand the needed game flow
 - **Using Git and Github:** Gained hands-on experience with Git workflow and executed common Git commands in the terminal and VS Code's SCM; Created and managed a Github repo for this project 
 - **DOM Manipulation:** Used DOM methods to make an interactive UI  
 - **Callback Functions:** Married JavaScript callback functions to DOM event listeners to create an event-driven game
